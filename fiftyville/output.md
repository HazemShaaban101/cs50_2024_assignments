|     |         |      |       |     | ed. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, |
|     |         |      |       |     |  I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thie |

| 163 | Raymond | 2023 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who |
|     |         |      |       |     |  talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard |
|     |         |      |       |     |  the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest  |
|     |         |      |       |     | flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the  |
|     |         |      |       |     | person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight  |
|     |         |      |       |     | ticket.                                                      |
